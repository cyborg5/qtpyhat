# QT Py Hat Software

This is the software bundle that goes with an upcoming Adafruit Learning Guide.

It is an infrared remote control that is controlled via a webpage over your local Wi-Fi network.

Uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W, an Adafruit QT Py SAMD21, and a custom open-source board to connect them and add infrared receiver and transmitter circuitry.

When complete, the learning guide will be available at
